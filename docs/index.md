This tutorial is an effort to provide processing code strings for the purpose of using Deep Learning architectures for land cover disturbance mapping, combining Google Earth Engine and Google Colab. This material essentially focuses on mapping burned areas at a regional scale, so that it can be replicated for local or larger scale work.
