# About me

My name is Yonatan Tarazona Coronel. I am a PhD student at the University of Coimbra, Portugal. I studied a master's degree in Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain. My country is Peru with a background in geographic engineering. *I am an assistant professor at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica del Peru*.

Since my undergraduate studies, I have shown great interest in two aspects: i) numbers, and ii) how space technology through Remote Sensing is able to record information from the earth's surface.

The idea of collecting information from space without coming into direct contact with it in order to make inventories and monitor our natural resources to prevent their degradation, has led me with great enthusiasm to acquire and increase my skills in the field of satellite remote sensing. *In this career of an insatiable appetite to acquire knowledge*, I finished my master, which allowed me to improve and consolidate my knowledge and skills in the domain of optical remote sensing, and additionally my beginnings in microwave remote sensing, radar. After having published several research papers in various scientific journals I still had the need, the interest and the enthusiasm to start a journey as a PhD student, so here we go.
